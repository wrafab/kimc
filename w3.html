    <h3> Week 3| PLASMA CUTTING / Introduction to Welding </h3>
    <br>
    <p>
The task for this week is to use plasma cutting to make our own design.

    <h3>Process</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
This week, we experienced a little bit of welding. My first welding experience was scary - it was really challening to control my hand, not be scared of the flames and the dark! However, I really wish to be able to weld better one day!
Also, Setting up the plasma machine was really interesting (and difficult) - we had to drill out the back woonden board, and fill the space with water. I did not know that there were these many types of cutting/carving. So far, I have just experienced CNC, so I was really excited to try plasma cutting! (The first three photos are from welding, and the fourth photo is from setting up the plasma machine)

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
We did not have enough time to use the plasma machine after we set it up, so we are going to do this project after we get back from Spring break! I included the plasma files below.
