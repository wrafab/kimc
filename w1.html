    <h1> WEEK 1| USING VCARVE </h1>

    <h3> Week 1 | VCarve </h3>
    <br>
    <p>
       The task for this week was to use VCarve to create our name plate. 'V-Carve' is an application that allows to cut parts on a CNC Router. This app has the ability to transform 2D designs to 3D designs, and calculate its toolpath.
The most challenging part of this project was to set the machine up for use. Since it was my first using the machine, I was struggling to figure out which button to press. Although a bit overwhelming at first, the machine seemed to be relatively straightforward.

    <h3>Process</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
     
To make using the machines an easier process, I will explain the steps I took:
      1) Save your files as a "shopsabre inch.tap" file on a flashdrive
      2) Go to the CNC machine
      3) After you open up the Router, press "home"
      4) Bring the magnet close to the left edge and "auto z" or "z-zero" 
      5) Then, bring the magnet to the left edge and "x-y zero" 
      6) You are done setting up the machine! :) 
      
      Once you are done, open your file, and start printing!

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <br>
    <p>

 I used 0.5 bit to print my whole name plate. Although I was planning to change the bit after it printed out the edge, I could not as the machine still seemed daunting. Seeing the outcome, I liked and disliked the result. I was amazed by the capacity of the machine, and what it can create; however, I was not very satisfied because I did not set the program to print out a more deeper depth. </p>
