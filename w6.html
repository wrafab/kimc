    <h3> Week 6 | RESERVE LOGO PRINT </h3>
    <br>
    <p>
The task for this week was to mill out a Reserve seal on the CNC milling machine by using V-Carve. We used a 1/4 inch ball nose and a engraving bit to carve this out. We thought that carving the seal out would be successful in one trial, it actually took us several trials.

 <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
The first trial did not go well because the pocket depth was too deep, causing the wood to be penetrated. Also, there were several cases when the machine stopped working over night.
Therefore, we changed the pocket depth to be less, and ran the machine again. This time, it came out to be successful!
